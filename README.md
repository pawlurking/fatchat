#### I2I (Issues & To-Improves)

- at profile page, once uploading avatar results a new avatar in cloudinary, improving this by replacing the old avatar by the latest uploaded one!
- at login page, implement user forgot password case via email
- enable user to flexibly change their email associated with current account (suggestions: generate unchangeable unique id for each account instance/requiring user to put preferred username when signup)
- future add-on features:
  - generate & scanning QR code to search account profile in additions to via email address searching
  - adding speech-to-text feature on conversation chat
  - allowing users to exchange voice-chat in additions to text & image
